        <h6>Implications</h6>
        <p>
          Aesthetics:<br>
          Aesthetics is making the charector look good, this is useful because the end user will not play the game if the charectors or animations look bad. 
          i will adress this by making sure i put a lot of effort into creating and testing the animations. i will also make sure is get feedback on the design of my charector.
          i will focus my atention on the eyes and the mouth to make sure my charector emotes correctly. i will also make sure my rigging has enough bones so that the charictor movements look nataral.<br>
          functonality:<br>
          functonality is making the charector work. this is usful because the end user will not enjoy the game if the charector model is broken or the animations dont work
          i will ensure great functionalty by testing the animations to look for errors such asanimation clipping, i will also make sure my charictor model is the correct size and not to complex so it wont lag.
          i will make sure the rigging it good so the the body parts move well.<br>
          usability:<br>
          usability is making the charector easy to use. this is good because the end user wil not play if the animation it too jumpy to see what is going on.
          i will make sure my charictor has good usability by focusing attention on the animations in order to make them run smoothly without being umpy or unnataral.
          i will make sure the movements of the charector are large enough to be seen at a distance so the end user will be able to see what is going on. <br>
          Interlectual property:<br>
          Interlectual property is about making sure that you are not using someone elses copyrighted work in your design. i will make sure i dont use someone elses work by making sure i check
