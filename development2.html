    <h2>im making the inventory system with stats and items. it can be used to equip items. it has two occumpaning functions, one to equip an item, and one to print the inventory</h2>

    <h6>Testing</h6>
    <p>i need to use insert instead of append so it doesnt change the index value, because it is causing errors. </p>
    <h6>Feedback</h6>
    <p>charlie told me that i should make it easier to read because it is not obvios. i will probably do this by changing the colours. he also said that i should split up the stats more.</p>
    <h6>improvements</h6>
    <p></p>
    <h6>Testing</h6>
    <p>if the user cancels on the options prompt then it deletes the item from inventory.</p>

    <p>i made it so that if you cancel it does not remove from inventory</p>
