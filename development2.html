    <h6>devolopment</h6>
    <p>first i planned out what i was acctuly gonna doand how i was gonna do it.<br> then i created a loop that prints the inventory<br> then i made a input so that the user could equip items<br>i then added stats because i knew i would need them when i add combat</p>
    <h6>Testing</h6>
    <p>i need to use insert instead of append so it doesnt change the index value, because it is causing errors. </p>
    <h6>Feedback</h6>
    <p>what do you like about the inventory?<br>oisin:<br>i thought it was good that it worked.<br>charlie<br>i think the stats and equip functoins are good<br><br>what didnt you like about the inventory?<br>oisin:<br>i thought it was noisy and a bit bland font and style<br>charlie<br>i think there needs to be colour on the text, or somthing to differntiate the stats and items<br><br>any other thoughts<br>both:<br>no<br>i will adress this feedback by adding colour and format</p>
    <h6>improvements</h6>
    <p>i made the stats in italics and the item in bold so that there is more of a visual differnce. i also replaced the insert() with append().</p>
